# Home Made Service Provider
By Simon Danielsson, 2025

## Why?
Because certain courses require me to not utilize existing NuGet Packages. So I've decided to create my own (very basic) service provider.

## Should I use this?
No, use the official [DI package managed by Microsoft](https://www.nuget.org/packages/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection).
